Reranking: <span class="text-muted">Homework 4</span>
==============================================================

In [homework 2](hw2.html) you learned to search for probable translations,
but saw that this is only useful with a good probability model. In 
[homework 3](hw3.html) you designed a metric that correlated (at least 
somewhat) with human assessments of machine translation. Armed with such 
a metric, you now have an objective way to measure a model's usefulness. In 
this assignment we will give you some sentences from Russian news articles, 
and you will use the metric to improve a model that chooses from a set of
possible English translations generated by a state-of-the-art machine
translation system. __Your challenge is to choose the best 
translations.__ 

Getting Started
---------------

To begin, download the [Homework 4 starter kit](http://seas.upenn.edu/~cis526/hw4.zip).
You may either choose to develop locally or on Penn's servers. For the latter, we
recommend using the Biglab machines, whose memory and runtime restrictions are much
less stringent than those on Eniac. The Biglab servers can be accessed directly
using the command `ssh PENNKEY@biglab.seas.upenn.edu`, or from Eniac using the
command `ssh biglab`.

In the downloaded directory, you have a program that chooses
a translation for each sentence from a list of candidates.

    python rerank > english.out

The reranker reads candidate translations from the file
`data/dev+test.100best`. Every candidate translation $$e\in E(f)$$ of
an input sentence $$f$$ has an associated feature vector 
$$h(e,f) = [ -\log p_{LM}(e)$$, $$-\log p_{TM}(f|e)$$, $$-\log p_{TM_{Lex}}(f|e)]$$. The
reranker takes a parameter vector $$\theta$$ whose length is equal to
that of $$h(e,f)$$. By default, $$\theta = [-1, -\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}]$$. For
each $$f$$, the reranker returns $$\hat{e}$$ according to the
following decision function.

<center>
$$\hat{e} = \arg\max_{e\in E(f)} \theta \cdot h(e,f)$$
</center>

To evaluate translations on the development set, compute BLEU
score against their reference translations.

    python compute-bleu < english.out

What's the best you could you do by picking other sentences
from the list? To give you an idea, we've given you an oracle for the
devlopment data. Using knowledge of the reference translation, it chooses
candidate sentences that maximize the BLEU score.

    python oracle | python compute-bleu

The oracle should convince you that it is possible to do _much_
better than the default reranker. Maybe you can improve it by changing
the parameter vector $$\theta$$. Do this using command-line
arguments to `rerank`. Try a few different settings. How close can
you get to the oracle BLEU score? 

The Challenge
-------------

You can improve the parameter vector by trial and error,
but that won't be very efficient. To really improve the system you need
automation. There are two components you can add: informative
features that correlate with BLEU, and effective learning algorithms that
optimize $$\theta$$ for BLEU. Your task is to improve translation quality 
on the blind test set as much as possible by improving these components.

Implementing a version of MERT or PRO along with some simple feature 
engineering should be enough to beat our baseline.
However, there will still be substantial room for improvement.
Here are some ideas:

* Add a feature that counts the number of words.
* Add a feature to count words that appear to be untranslated.
* Learn new features from [this word-aligned Russian-English text](http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/cdyer/train.ru-en.align.gz).
* Develop a [syntactic language model](http://www.isi.edu/natural-language/projects/rewrite/mtsummit03.pdf).
* Add a [neural language model](http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D13/D13-1140.pdf).
* Find a consensus translation using [minimum Bayes risk](http://aclweb.org/anthology//N/N04/N04-1022.pdf).

But the sky's the limit! You can try anything you want, as long as
you follow the ground rules.

Ground Rules
------------

* You must work **independently** on this assignment.
* You must turn in three things:
  1. Your translations of `dev+test.src`, selected from `dev+test.100best`.
     Upload your results with the command `turnin -c cis526 -p hw4 hw4.txt` from
     any Eniac or Biglab machine. You
     can upload new output as often as you like, up until the assignment deadline. 
     You will be able to see your results on test data after the deadline.

  2. Your code, uploaded using the command `turnin -c cis526 -p hw4-code file1 file2 ...`.
     This is due 24 hours after the leaderboard closes.
     You are free to extend the code we provide or write your own in whatever
     langugage you like, but the code should be self-contained,
     self-documenting, and easy to use.

    3.  A report describing the models you designed and experimented with, uploaded
        using the command `turnin -c cis526 -p hw4-report hw4-report.pdf`. This is
        due 24 hours after the leaderboard closes. Your report does not need to be
        long, but it should at minimum address the following points:

        * **Motivation**: Why did you choose the models you experimented with?

        * **Description of models or algorithms**: Describe mathematically or algorithmically
	  what you did.
          Your descriptions should be clear enough that someone else in the class could
	  implement them.

        * **Results**: You most likely experimented with various settings of any models
	  you implemented.
          We want to know how you decided on the final model that you submitted for us to grade.
          What parameters did you try, and what were the results?
          Most importantly: what did you learn?

        Since we have already given you a concrete problem and dataset, you do not
        need describe these as if you were writing a full scientific paper. Instead,
        you should focus on an accurate technical description of the above items.

        Note: These reports will be made available via hyperlinks on the leaderboard.
        Therefore, **you are not required to include your real name** if you would prefer not
        to do so.
	
*  You do not need any other data than what we provide. You are
   free to use any code or software you like, __except for those
   expressly intended to generate or rerank translation output__. 
   You must write your own reranker. If you want to use machine
   learning libraries, taggers, parsers, or any other off-the-shelf resources,
   feel free to do so. If you aren't sure whether 
   something is permitted, ask us. If you want to do system combination, 
   join forces with your classmates.

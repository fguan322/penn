How are you going to build a machine translation system unless you know at
least a little bit about language? For this project, you will be required to research a language.  You will:

* gather monolingual and bilingual data for the language
* investigate where it is spoken, and what other languages its speakers are exposed to
* collect information about the syntax and morphology of the language
* describe its writing system
* create your own natural language processing tools for the language

For this exercise, we are going to target *low resource languages* which are languages that are not handled well by statistical machine translation, usually because they have an insufficient amount of training data.  Here is a [list of languages that you can choose from](list-of-languages.html).

This is a group project, and you can work in teams of 2-6 people (the amount of work that we expect from you will vary depending on the size of your team).

The requirements for this project are the f

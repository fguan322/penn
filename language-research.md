So far in the class we have mainly focused on the mathematics and algorithms that underly machine translation systems,  In this project we will examine properties of languages. Some of these properties make machine translation more challenging.   You will form a team and research a language.  You will:

* gather monolingual and bilingual data for the language
* investigate where it is spoken, and what other languages its speakers are exposed to
* collect information about the syntax and morphology of the language
* describe its writing system
* create your own natural language processing tools for the language

For this exercise, we are going to target *low resource languages* which are languages that are not handled well by statistical machine translation, usually because they have an insufficient amount of training data.  Here is a [list of languages that you can choose from](list-of-languages.html).  If you would like to pick a different language, please ask for permission from your instructor. This project is inspired by the upcoming [DARPA Low Resource Languages for Emergent Incidents (LORELEI) Program](http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/I2O/Programs/Low_Resource_Languages_for_Emergent_Incidents_(LORELEI).aspx).

This is a group project, and you can work in teams of 2-6 people (the amount of work that we expect from you will vary depending on the size of your team).


Core requirements for all teams regardless of size:

* Harvest monolingual data written in that language.  Good sources for this might be: 
-- [Wikipedia database dumps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download#Other_languages)
- Web crawling international news services like the [Voice of America](http://www.voanews.com/#), the [BBC World Service](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ws/languages), [Deutsche Welle](http://www.dw.de), [Global Voices](http://globalvoicesonline.org/#)
* Try to find bilingual data for the language.  Potential sources for this are:
- The Bible
- The Universal Declaration of Human Rights
- [Global Voices](http://globalvoicesonline.org/#)
- Inter-linear glosses from grammar books about the language
- Finding a bilingual speaker of the language of the language and asking him or her to translate some sentences for you

Here are some useful resources for researching languages:

* Check out books on the language from the library. 
* [World Atlas of Language Structures](http://wals.info/)
* [Ethnologue](http://www.ethnologue.com/)
* [Omniglot](http://www.omniglot.com/)
* [About World Languages](http://www.aboutworldlanguages.com/)
* [Machine Translation Archive](http://www.mt-archive.info/)

Alien Translation & Leaderboard Setup
=============================================================

### Leaderboard

In this course, the coding portion of each assignment will be graded automatically
in real-time, with results being made available on the leaderboard after they are
processed. An email confirmation will accompany each submission. You may submit
as many times as you like before the deadline, but only your final result will be
used when assigning an overall grade for the assignment. 

### Homework 0

[This handout](handout1.pdf) shows a parallel corpus between two alien languages.
You'll use this data to translate some alien words and sentences.

1. Try to draw lines between the words that are translations of each
   other. Start out by finding words that occur in multiple source sentences,
   like "ghirok", and see if you can find words that appear in all of the
   corresponding target sentences. Do you notice any patterns in how the
   words translate? Do you think that the prefix "ok-" corresponds to something?
   *You do not have to turn anything in for this step.*

2. [This file](hw0_input.txt) contains some words and sentences. Write a text
   file named hw0.txt containing your translations, one per line, and submit it
   on Biglab using the following instructions.

### Submission Instructions

1. Create two additional text files of one line each with your desired leaderboard
   alias (the name by which you will be identified on the leaderboard) and preferred
   email address. Name them alias.txt and email.txt, respectively.

2. Log in to Biglab, either directly using the command

        ssh PENNKEY@biglab.seas.upenn.edu

   or by first logging into Eniac, then logging into Biglab using the command sequence

        ssh PENNKEY@eniac.seas.upenn.edu
        ssh biglab

3. From Biglab, submit your alias, email address, and translation files using the
   following command:

        turnin -c cis526 -p hw0 alias.txt email.txt hw0.txt

It is crucial that you submit from Biglab, as this is the server on which the
leaderboard monitor script will be running. If you submit from another location,
your submission will be recorded, but your score will not be updated on the
leaderboard, and you will not receive an email confirmation.

Any questions should be be posted on the
[course Piazza page](https://piazza.com/upenn/spring2015/cis526).
